# first-pcb
I created this project in order to learn how to use Kicad and how the procces works. Hopefully in the future I can create more complicated designs. By the way the github file upload got a little messed up. If there are duplciates of any file, please look at the most recent one, thanks(I'm used to using hte CLI, but didn't want to screw anything up). Also the banner for on blueprint is outdated, but I forgot to chagne it. Sorry
